<p>Realms Network is a new cloud server network with many interesting ways to play. You can chat in Chatting Realms, burn someone in Griefer Realms, etc.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<ul>
<li>No asking for co-owner or moderator. I'm not giving that out to you.</li>
<li>No griefing (with the exception of Griefer Realms)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Servers</h2>

<p>There are tons of gamemodes that you can play on REALMS NETWORK. All of them are absolutely fun.</p>

<h3>Infinite Realms (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=a35db81c3213946ff34e02f3a4b3b87a" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>The biggest server of them all, both in world size and players. Like the 2 servers below, this server is survival. It is 16x in world size. Griefing and stealing is not allowed at all here.</p>

<h3>Tiny Realms (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=5b29d0d6bc8599bec2f7aeca8a27081a" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>This server shares the same rules as Infinite Realms, but the only exception is that the world is only 1x (normal) in world size.</p>

<h3>Griefer Realms (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=4729a5802cf21b8c59b245dd1e3878d6" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>If you love griefing, this server is for you. Survive in this 16x sized world, but endure the threats of griefing and stealing. If you get griefed, it's not anyone's fault. Remember, you can get revenge on whoever griefed or stole from you. Building underground bases or bases in the sky are really helpful if you want to thrive without anyone invading your privacy.</p>

<h3>Micro Realms (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=b07883410d1182a98c965504f442ed89" rel="nofollow">Join<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="1 click">1</span></a>)</h3>

<p>This is the tiniest server of them all. It is 1/16 the size of normal worlds. It shares the same basic rules as Infinite Realms and Tiny Realms.</p>

<h3>Full Bar Realms (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=9777610d77177e1f39f063fe468e02eb" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>If you hate it when your health, happiness, or hunger bars are low, join Full Bar Realms. These bars never decrease.</p>

<h3>FREEDOM REALMS (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=07bbf1489ba6aac9ccfc57eace6cc81a" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>Everything at a trade portal is free. And much more custom twists to the Blockheads using custom rules.</p>

<h3>HARDCORE REALMS (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=e9ef47d4b3ec0199f0c73afd01af0375" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>Using custom rules, we've made this world hard to survive in. It's extremely dry, oceans are huge, and things decay faster. Good luck, because you'll need it.</p>

<h3>SEA REALMS (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=356796396acab9fd1a7078421c37e319" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>You spawn on an island. And the rest is sea. How will you survive when the entire world is aquatic?</p>

<h3>STUNT REALMS (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=941e5874c5d32235d3d8e9646cb70c1a" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>Handcars, rails, and your hand is all it takes to make your own awesome stunt for this map!</p>

<h3>EXPLORATION REALMS</h3>

<p>Roam around this world. You can't die or modify the world.</p>

<h3>RESPAWN REALMS (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=869e9a9b8965002e95dd17f438917ec0" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>When you log out, you die. Otherwise, it's just a normal sized world with PvP enabled and no other changes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>META SERVERS</h2>

<p>These are servers that you do not really play on; instead, you do something related to The Blockheads or Realms Network's features.</p>

<h3>HTML REALMS (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=d7f4938a307a304c32be1427e15fa5ac&amp;name=HTML%20TESTING" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>This is a testing ground for the HTML used in welcome messages. There is nothing else to do other than that.</p>

<h3>CHAT REALMS (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=73ce25b7f4f9051e2db25fd38aee03d5" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>Anyone can log on and chat about things here!</p>

<h2>BETA SERVERS</h2>

<p>These servers are inaccessible until they come out of the black hole known as a beta period. They will be moved to the proper post when they come out of beta. The server creation limit may delay creation of these servers. They are sorted by priority.</p>

<h3>EASY REALMS</h3>

<p>The most noob-friendly server on the network, EASY REALMS disables all the bars, and increases loot, island, and ore chances. You need a version of Blockheads with custom rules to play this. This has no griefing, stealing, and PvP enabled, just like INFINITE REALMS. This is a survival server. It has 16x world size.</p>

<h3>ART GALLERY REALMS</h3>

<p>Make paintings and ask an admin to put them on a public gallery wall! This world is 16x the normal world size, so your painting will definitely fit on the wall!</p>

<h3>INFINITE REALMS ESPAÑOL</h3>

<p>This is the classic INFINITE REALMS expirence, but you must speak Spanish in chat. (Español)</p>

<h3>STAFF REALMS</h3>

<p>All staff on the network can access here. They do not get staff on this server, however. Regular users cannot join, so the link will not work for them.</p>

<h3>METROPOLIS REALMS</h3>

<p>This is a city-themed survival server! Rent apartments! Setup shops! Buy property! Put money in the local bank!</p>

<h2>COMPETITION SERVERS</h2>

<p>Every month a new server will be released. Old servers will have building disabled. There are no staff on here. Prizes will be a server of your own as part of the REALMS NETWORK.</p>

<h3>MAY '16 (<a href="http://theblockheads.net/join.php?id=5b9dcd9bf264e60cdfb16f5bcab87f2e" rel="nofollow">Join</a>)</h3>

<p>This theme is Gardening! Plant flowers, trees, and other plants and try to earn the prize, your very own server!</p>

<p>Now, the competition is over! This world will be protected forever.</p>
